[To be uploaded](#)

A number guessing game created as part of the "Modern JavaScript from the Begining" Udemy course by the amazing Brad Traversy.\

The Number Guessing Game project uses the Skeleton css library.

The orginal version as coded in the tutorial can be played [here.](#)

I have made a couple of changes and have added the following:

Added Game Play
- User selects minimum and maximum number in guessing range.
- User is shown guesses made through the game.
- After guess the focus/cursor is back at the number input.

Styling
- Added a card style container with a dark background.
